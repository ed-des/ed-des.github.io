			<h1>03-01: What are our objectives?</h1>
		</header>
		
		<h1>Group 1: Boong, Jia, Jamie</h1>
		<p>What is the value of this course today? Technical abilities, most classes are conceptual. This is a good balance between technical and conceptual. The screen and web have a lot of potential that can be explored. It's relevant. "Whatever the future brings" - Dylan Greif</p>
		<p>What do I want to get out of this semester? To understand code. How to tell narrative on the web. Expand in the variety of tools we can use, not limited to the screen (such as tablets and phones). Understand the relationship between print and screen.</p>
		
		<h1>Group 2: Sarah, May, Jason</h1>
		<p>what is the value of this course today?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>engage a different user group / audience</li>
			<li>ephemeral quality of print</li>
			<li>print as less ephemeral than screen based experiences</li>
			<li>new technology that people are still beginning to understand to design for</li>
			<li>new technological frontier</li>
			<li>most of our time is spent looking at a screen – how to best design that experience</li>
		</ul>
		<p>What do I want to get out of this semester? </p>
		<ul>
			<li>learn to code</li>
			<li>learn how to design for screen</li>
			<li>proportional and changing screen sizes across platforms and browser window size</li>
			<li>learning the limitations and the boundaries of screen-based design</li>
			<li>being able to articulate a design to a programmer</li>
			<li>maximizing the platform potential – only available for screen based experiences</li>
			<li>translating print to screen and vice versa</li>
			<li>immersive experiences that exist both online and in print</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Group 3: Emily, Ingrid, Grace</h1>
		<p>what is the value of this course today? We spent so much time looking at and interacting with screens. It’s important for designers to think about how to improve the experience for the better.</p>
		<p>What do I want to get out of this semester? Understand the difference between print and digital. Are they mutually exclusive? How to maintain that narrative from print to digital? Currently, it’s hard to think about designing for the screen without referencing to how we traditionally think about print design. We are interested in exploring new ways for screen design that’s exclusive. It’s very uncomfortable to read on the digital screen. How can we improve the experience for the better? We are interested in exploring the future of interaction design. </p>
		
		<h1>Group 4: Andrew, Shuyao, Ruth</h1>
		<p>What is the value of this course today? A lot of editorial design is transitioning from print to screen, and the web is the new big medium that everyone’s experimenting with, so it would be nice to get a handle on how to work it.</p>
		<p>What do I want to get out of this class? to learn HTML/CSS, and see what it can do. In previous HTML/CSS workshops, we learned the basics for how it works and how to position things so it looks like a website, but it would be nice to know how to get it to be a working interactive thing that’s connected to other things on the web. Also, how to make a site that can have stuff be added in later? And to learn what exactly editorial design for the screen is… What is encompasses. </p>

		<h1>Group 5: Kaitlyn, Catherine, Laura</h1>
		<p>What is the value of this course today? Enables us to expand our design vocabulary and toolset so we are not limited to one mode of working. It's also highly relevant: so many print publications are transitioning to screen.</p>
		<p>What do I want to get out of this class? Become more comfortable with designing for the screen. Become stronger at coding and use it as a more intuitive tool. Become familiar with coding, which is daunting because of the technical aspect, through something we already enjoy and recognize–editorial design.</p>
