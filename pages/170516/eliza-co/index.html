				<span>Who are you and what is this assignment?</span>
				<p>
				Eliza Chen is a Graphic Design student at RISD. Giovanni Cortez is a Journalism major at The New School and together they worked to construct a hypothetical poster, designed to transmit news as we see it 10-15 years into the future..
				</p>
				<span>What is the project?</span>
				<p>
				The project is entitled "Action Mailer", which turns breaking news into a form in which it can be readily shared. A foldable article turned poster, Action Mailer is designed to easily raise awareness.
				</p>
				<span>Who is it for?</span>
				<p>
				This poster is for the people of 2030 to readily fight facism and be a vehicle for spreading crucial information.
				</p>
				<span>In what circumstances</br>is it used?</span>
				<p>
				"Action Mailer" will be widely distributed as it is meant to be used in every chance possible, as fighting inequality is perpetually necessary. The design also allows users to stay informed while accessing the ability to move that same knowledge continously forward as well.
				</p>
				<span>Why is it valuable and different from</br>anything else?</span>
				<p>
				We intend for the piece to be essential in the daily lives of the people of 2030. Assuming news flow can and will perhaps be controlled and manipulated, it is detrimental to put issues in the hands of the people.
				</p>
				<span>What is the end-to-end experience?</span>
				<p>
				"Action Mailer" is essentially a foldable bill. Inside the flier is a piece of information and news, but when folded out, it becomes an easily distributed poster.
				</p>
				<span>What does the experience feel like?</span>
				<p>
				The experience of "Action Mailer" feels pivotal, while also disseminatable. It is a poster that holds weight and feels personal, but also creates a need to be shared, though not disposible. There is an understanding that the more people it reaches, the better.
				</p>
				<span>What was your process putting it together?</span>
				<p>
				The process was a rigorous system of collaboration. The approach began with postcards that were shared weekly, until ideas were fleshed out and it required going digital. From there, the collaboration heavily depended upon weekly conversation, idea correspondence, and shared folders to optimize communication as well as idea flow.
				</p>
				<span>What is the school, semester/year, instructor?</span>
				<p>
				Both Eliza Chen and Giovanni Cortez are undergraduate students at their respective universities and students of Dylan Greif's design courses.
