<h1> who are you and what is this assignment? </h1>
    <br>
<p> My name is Omotola Omolayole and this assignment is a project collaboration between myself and Do Yun Kwak. This project features a breaking news poster about global warming and the rising sea levels particularly in New York City's Hudson River.<br><br> It is for the general public to understand the dangers of rising sea levels. It's used to inform people about the dangers of global warming and how rising sea levels affect large cosmopolitan cities like Manhattan. Here are some examples: </p></div>

          <div id="caption"><p>Seas are now rising 50% faster in New York area than the global average. This means disasters like Hurricane Sandy which hit the city in October 2012, could become a more regular occurrence. Causing the city's transportation facilities, including airports, commuter trains, subways and highways to effectively shut down.</p></div>

        <span>As a leading global city, New York has the chance to help address global warming by promoting efficient energy use and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Setting an example for what other cities can do to tackle changes in the world’s temperature.  “New York City is the heart of the developed world. If it does things right, it can radiate inspiration to other places” Henk Ovink, the special envoy for international water affairs for the Netherlands. </span></div>

<h1> Why is it valuable and different from anything else? </h1>
    <br>
<p> Its valuable because it passes across a news story and raises general awareness for such an important topic but in a clean well-designed manner. It is an animation infographic that focuses more on clean aesthetics and graphs and less on heavy illustrations</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>What is the end to end experience</h1> 
    <br>
<p>We want viewers to be immediately be able to understand the possible threats of Global warming, especially on the surrounding water bodies around us. By the end of going through the poster, they will be informed on the problem New York City faces as a whole,and how native New Yorkers will be affected if they dont make changes to their lifestyle.</p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>What does the experience feel like?</h1> 
    <br>
<p>They user is meant to go away feeling informed, but not like they were just overloaded with a bunch of information. The video wil be short, clean and straight to the point.</p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<h1>What was your process of putting it together?</h1>
    <br>
<p>It was interesting experience putting it together, firstly communicating via postcard then eventually through email. We were deliberate on the way we want the animation to be portrayed so users can quickly grasp what is being presented, but in an interesting straight forward way.</p>
