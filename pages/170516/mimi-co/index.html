                <p>Welcome to a future where over half the population spends their lives in virtual reality. Work performed in it is meaningless, the time spent, wasted, but people either do not notice or do not care. </p>

                <p>Even as war raged in the real world and rained devastation upon unfortunate cities, they remained at home, cluelessly enjoying a falsely idyllic reality. Rather than face the decline of their country, they have latched onto the closest available means of escape. </p>

                <p>This is a message to break them from their digital reverie, though by now it may be too little too late... </p>

            <p>This project was a collaboration between a graphic design student from RISD and a journalism student from The New School. We were restricted to snail mail correspondence in the initial stages of the correspondence so the postcards below show our early exchanges as we discussed mutual topics of interest and possible formats the news could take.</p>

                <p>In order to reflect the opposing realities between virtual and real life, we decided to incorporate a lenticular hologram. From one angle, viewers will see what they have been led to believe the US is like: modern and prosperous. From the opposite side, they will see a the realities of country affected by war: ruins, dirt, and devastation. </p>

            <p>The package will be delivered to the homes of the VR addicted. Upon receiving the box, users open it and become aware of the real world again. The text explains what happened to them, and details what is going on outside of VR. The box can then become a stand and put anywhere to display the contrast between both realities.</p>
