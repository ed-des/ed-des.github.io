  <p>This poster is for the general public living in the United States of America.</p>

  <h2 class="questions">Q.In what circumstances is it used?</h2>
  <p>This poster is used to pasted in Americans homes celebrating and welcoming a new face to the Oval Office. Being the first black transwoman president our objective is to present Laverne Cox as a role model for many trans people that can bring hope and positivity into the lives of Americans.</p>

  <h2 class="questions">Q.Why is it valuable and different from anything else?</h2>
  <p>This poster is valuable and different from anything because it is realistic and something that we can possibly look forward to in the future for future generations. It brings exposure to a minoritiy group that is often ignored or made inivisible. This is one way we can make a long lasting historic event for the trans community.</p>

  <p>Every American citizen will receive this poster in an envelope in their mail box. They will open it up, look at the front and back and post it in their rooms, outside, living room etc.</p>

  <h2 class="questions">Q.What does the experience feel like?</h2>
  <p>The experience is a very tactile and traditional poster feel. Because people don't send each other a lot of snail mail anymore, we thought it would be nice to have this poster sent through snail mail to each household in the U.S.</p>

  <h2 class="questions">Q.What was your process putting it together?</h2>
  <p>Both students agreed to Facetime each other every Sunday night to discuss the progress of the poster and work on the poster and presentation together. </p>
