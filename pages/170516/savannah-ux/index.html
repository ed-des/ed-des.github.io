        <h1> Project-ux: <br>Post-it News</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>what is this assignment?</h2>
    <p>The assignment is to take as a premise that paper can be “smart”, and design how a breaking news story can be accessed and experienced by a user. The news story will be: we landed on mars.</p>
    
    <h2>what is the project?</h2>
    <div>

    </div>
    <p>What if you could share the news by posting it on a real, physical wall? The goal is to keep the virtues and limitations of both paper and smart technology in a way that lets them work smoothly together.</p>

    <h2>who is it for?</h2>
    <p>It's for people who love the tactile qualities of paper and who want the latest news headlines in a way that is very portable and easy and fun to share.</p>

    <h2>in what circumstances is it used?</h2>
    <p>The post-its can be used anywhere but they would be best used in a close community like an office, apartment, neighborhood, or club/team environment. It's a way for the user to share news with those nearby in a fun tactile way that is familiar and useful.</p>

    <h2>why is it valuable and different from anything else?</h2>
    <p>It is a new way of getting the news the user wants while keeping the tactile, temporary, and portable elements of post-its AND the updating, display, and interactive abilities of "smart" technology. Basically, it has the best of both the paper and technology worlds.</p>

    <h2>what is the end-to-end experience?</h2>

    <h2>what does the experience feel like?</h2>
    <p>The experience should be a little unexpected and fun. The satisfaction of ripping off a sticky note and leaving a little trail of them on the wall is kind of wonderful and when each of these pages have the added value of sharing the news with others, the experience is even better.</p>

    <h2>what was your process putting it together?</h2>
    <p>I designed wireframes, keyframes, and a tactile experience that I myself would enjoy. I prefer to see news headlines and a lot of them, rather than reading an entire news story. I'd rather just find out what happened than read some reporter's spin on an event and this is a fun way to get only the headlines and be able to share them with those around me. </p>

    <h2>what is the school, semester/year, instructor, etc.?</h2>
    <p>Savannah Sturm is a Senior in Graphic Design at RISD. The professor is Dylan Greif.</p>
