            <h2>Expanding our notion of screen.</h2>
            <p>Up until now, we have employed the web as a playground for a broader inquiry into deeper editorial design concepts, including: interaction, identity, adaptivity, time, and narrative. Now, let’s look beyond the web. How can we design editorial experiences by expanding out notion of the screen? Here are few examples to draw on. What are their objectives? Where do they succeed? Where do they fail?</p>

            <p class="example-item" id="scroll-style">“Much of my own walking and writing in Rome centered on these elements that highlight a connection between the city and its technologies of representation. At the Palazzo Valentini you can walk into a space layered with four major moments in Roman history, from an ancient bath complex to a fascist bunker, all of which is experienced using glass floors, animated renderings, and projected choreographed digital effects. Here the digital invokes the ancient. The Vatican Map Room, a hallway covered with floor-to-ceiling frescoes, was the immersive Google Maps of its day. Renaissance artists were constantly trying to innovate techniques that transformed one material into another—glass into light, stone into flesh—in a way that makes the digital/analog divide seem quaint. And Rome has been continuously inhabited for so long that technological innovations, along with the social questions that arise as a result of those innovations, basically come with the territory.” <span>Rob Giampietro, <a href="http://risdmuseum.org/manual/410_building_a_bigger_picture_an_interview_with_rob_giampietro_of_google_design_ny" target="_blank">Building a Bigger Picture</a></span></p>

                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p>Choose one of these historical articles. Reimagine it as a serialized story, then design a new way for the reader of tomorrow to access and read it. Serialize it in one of the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parts Over Time. </strong>All published for the same screen format, with but with parts launched at different times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parts Over Space. </strong>All made available at the same time, but with parts published in different places, i.e. on different “screens” suitable to those places.</li>

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>To complete this design assignment, you must address the following challenges.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Editorial. </strong>Thinking of the original article as raw material for you to edit into something meaningful. Take editorial license to serve the reader experience you wish to create, and present it newly relevant, today. Cut content, add content, think of what you want users to get walk away with, and home in on it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audience. </strong>Have a clear idea who your audience is, and why your article would be valuable to them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access. </strong>Not only are you redesigning the article. You are reimagining how users access the article, and how they navigate between them. Where do they discover and/or browse them?</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity System. </strong>What editorial identity unifies the parts of your article across time/space?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="step-item" id="scroll-style">
                <h3>Schedule</h3>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Choose and ideate. (due 4/12) </strong>Choose an article and read it. While you do, think of different themes or categories it can be broken into. Sketch images, graphics, and visualizations that come to mind as you read it. Come up with a few ideas about what kind of take-away or experience you want readers to walk away with.</li>
                <li><strong>Put it in context. (due 4/19) </strong>Whan that abril with his shoures sote the drought of marche hath perced to the rote.</li>
                <li><strong>First draft of mockups and writing. (due 4/26) </strong>Whan that abril with his shoures sote the drought of marche hath perced to the rote.</li>
                <li><strong>Second draft of mockups and writing in web presentation. (due 5/3) </strong>Whan that abril with his shoures sote the drought of marche hath perced to the rote.</li>
                <li><strong>[Almost] final draft. (due 5/10)</strong>Whan that abril with his shoures sote the drought of marche hath perced to the rote.</li>
                <li><strong>Final draft. (due 5/17)</strong>Whan that abril with his shoures sote the drought of marche hath perced to the rote.</li>

                <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Mockups of the Article. </strong>Mockups of the newly designed story. (the whole thing, or just 3-5 parts)</li>
                <li><strong>Mockups of the User Experience. </strong>Mockups that demonstrate how it is accessed and used in context.</li>
                <li><strong>A descriptive writeup. </strong>A written description that introduces your concept, and explains how your design tackled all of the specified challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>A web presentation of the above. </strong>A mobile- and desktop-optimized web article to formally present your work (i.e. the mockups and writeup).</li>
