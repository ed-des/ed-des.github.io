        <h1>Wireframes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What does it do?</strong> It gets the idea of it across by showing the views and explaining how they would be used.</li>
            <li><strong>Why is this valuable?</strong>It serves as basis for an early UX proposal or product ideation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Video demo or presentation</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What does it do?</strong> It gets the idea of it across by showing the views and seeing someone use them in context.</li>
            <li><strong>Why is this valuable?</strong>It serves as basis for a final product proposal or a product discussion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Interactive prototypes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What does it do?</strong> It gets the idea across by having the audience see and use it in context. As opposed to wireframes, it does not need to be as supplemented with flow explanations. As opposed to video demos, it does not need to be as supplmeneted with context explanations.</li>
            <li><strong>Why is this valuable?</strong>Depending on the product, it can be useful for both early and final stages of product proposals, brainstorming, and discussion. More than other methods, it is best for testing the experience of the product. Does it work as intended? Are there unexpected ways it is being used? What else can the creators learn about its value from seeing it in action?</li>
