        <h1>ux. Mars Landing (wireframes + prototype)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Log (in your notebook, a document, etc.) 2-3 findings from your user research that help inform how you designed the user experience.</li>
            <li>Finalize your wireframes, which should cover the ideal, end-to-end user flow (and, 1-2 alternate end-to-end user flows).</li>
            <li>The wireframe should have 5+ views across the flow, supplemented by any copy that describes them.</li>
            <li>Design 3 keyframes with high fidelity visual designs.</li>
            <li>PRINT your wireframes and keyframes on landscape 11x17 paper/s.</li>
            <li>EXPORT your 11x17 doc/s as a PDF labeled as your first name (ex: dylan.pdf – one word, all lowercase).</li>
            <li>Upload the pdf to our shared google drive folder by 7:00AM next (next) Tuesday.</li>
            <li>PROTOTYPE it (again!). Make a to-scale print prototype of your device. If your device is much too large and cannot possibly be assembled, make a scaled-down version. Bring this in to class.</li>
        </ul>
