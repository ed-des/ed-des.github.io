 <div class="mywrite"> <em>A Little Bit of Sound Advice</em> is a work that reconstructs two separate texts: the first, a  commentary on design and content authored by Michael Rock, and the second, an excerpt from an interview with graphic designer Rob Giampietro. Rock’s piece, titled <em>Fuck Content</em>, asserts that the validity of design should not wholly depend on the quality of its content. To further explore this idea, these texts were cut and recombined to purposefully clash with each other. Giampietro’s writing, which emerges from a traditional interview format, is illustrated in a serif typeface, whereas Rock’s radical piece is set in sans serif. The reading experience is stilted, with each piece scrambling for attention. The different texts take turns dominating the narrative, which is shown through hidden texts (visible through hover), color, and line-stricken sentences. In the end, two excerpts from both pieces are taken wildly out of context and merged into one sentence, constructing a new narrative of its own.<strong> Sarah Im 2016.</strong </div>
