We are also beginning to piece together how signals from the immune system can affect the brain and the emotional and physical responses it controls: <span class=onep>the molecular basis of feeling sick.</span> In all this, the boundaries between mind and body are beginning to blur.

        The first quote is called <span class="title">How to Love: Legendary Zen Buddhist Teacher Thich Nhat Hanh on Mastering the Art of “Interbeing”</span> by <span class="author">Maria Popova </span> and second quote is called <span class="title">The Science of Stress and How Our Emotions Affect Our Susceptibility to Burnout and Disease </span> by the same author.
