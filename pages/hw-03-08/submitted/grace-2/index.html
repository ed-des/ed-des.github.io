    <p class="caption" style="margin-top:150px;">Of course, stay and settle in, and you realize you never communicated. Never really talked. Still don’t know how. All that fun, infatuation, and discovery got in the way. Dive beneath the surface, and you’ll find the things you don’t like.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">Why did you lie then?</p>

    <p class="caption">The people who find themselves most betrayed by the lies of lovers are those who have the most unrealistic expectations about truthfulness. And the people who are most inclined to believe the lies they shouldn't are the ones who tell themselves the biggest lie of them all: I never tell lies.</p>


<p class="quote">I don’t care. I never told you I wasn’t any of those things. You just never looked.</p>

	
    <p class="caption">But most of us do want to love and to be loved.</p>

     <h2>The Ones That Love And Lie</h2>
     <p>Quotes are from two essays,"The Ones That Got Away," and "Good Lovers Lie." As each essay provides a reflective, retrospective insight on the tribulations of love — love for a city, and love for a special person — and its duplicitous nature, the chosen quotes were extracted and rearranged in a way to evoke more of an in-the-moment narrative, enacting a dialogue between one's rationale and one's emotion upon the discovery of a lie.</p>
