<h1> HTML Layout Essentials</h1>
    
<p class="summary">This page is a tutorial of how to use inline elements and block elements in HTML and CSS as tools for laying out text and webpages. The tasks go step by step and build up into more complex layouts using inline and block elements as basic structures.

Made by Jamie Chen in Dylan Grief’s Editorial for Screen Class, RISD Spring 2016.</p>
<h2>Task 1: Example of grouping Element</h2>
<section class="elementgroup">
    <p class="subtitle">This is a section of stuff.An element is like a container you can put content in. While it’s not possible to give raw text different layout structures, styles, and interactive properties, it's possible to do this with elements that contain text. Moreover, elements can also contain embeddable media and even other elements. In html, an element is anything wrapped in an opening and closing tag.</p>
