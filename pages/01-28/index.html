		<h1>Design for Journalists</h1>
		<p><strong>In-class Assignment 1-28</strong></p>
		<p>This isn't a traditional class. The existence of this class makes assumptions about the challenges the professional world today faces. It also makes assumptions about what students today want to learn. As a group, write a sentence or two that describes one big challenge the industry today faces that this class may try to tackle. As individuals, write a sentence or two that describes something you want to learn today this class may try to offer. Put it all on one document and email it to me at greifd@newschool.edu.</p>

		<p>The challenge the industry faces is that journalists need more skills than just writing. This class tackles that by being the bridge between journalism writing and interactive design.</p>
		<p>Gabriella: wants to learn about coding</p>
		<p>Keilly: typography, cool stuff, making stuff pretty</p>
		<p>Odalis: how to make a site / how to integrate my writing in a way that is suitable for the web.</p>

		<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
		<p>Transparency that journalism faces today, the accessibility to each writers number of page views or ‘hits’, and the amount of time each person spends looking at a piece — news is becoming faster, people want to digest smaller amounts at a faster speed, so because of that...</p>
		<p>There’s less focus on a wider lens of news stories, news is more targeted and biased, with a certain agenda... It’s becoming more political and commercialized, pandering to lobbyists</p>
		<p><b>Interests</b></p>
		<p>The structure of a journalism piece rather than a fiction piece, to learn how to make a non-fiction story more appealing and intriguing, to keep the reader hooked, as well as how to make a journalism piece more aesthetically pleasing to the audience, to hook a reader with the appearance of the title, a photograph, etc.</p>

		<p>Claire: I would like to learn more about web design as well as creating a good online presence through design.</p>

		<p>Journalism is struggling because of the way that we access information. The language and tone of how we present information is changing to be more conversational. Everything needs to be designed in creative and appealing ways so people will pay attention. Information is more concise, and is paired with visuals. Everyone has the ability to put out content without a formal platform or editor or fact checker. People don't need to follow the traditional rules of journalism.</p>
		<p><b>Want to learn</b></p>
		<p>What are the most effective ways to put out content and connect to people?</p>
		<p>What are the ways that we can keep up as the industry changes?</p>
		<p>How do people perceive different visuals? Which work and which don’t?</p>
		<p>How can you change a “corporate” or “professional” voice into a more conversational voice while maintaining authority?</p>

		<p>As a group, we believe that some of the challenges faced in journalism today have to do with directing traffic, marketing and having one's work actually be seen in conjunction with the integration between news and social media. Additionally, finding a way to convince people to read the entire article as it has been found that most people spend less than a minute on news articles. Journalists need to recognize new technology as a new medium to share stories and must be able to keep up with these new mediums. </p>

			<h1>Latecia, Erica, Taylor</h1>

		<p>How do we, as an outlet that provides resources and information, keep up with the technological demands and advancements (e.g. entertaining, interactive, creative, new journalism) that our audience is drawn to?</p>
		<p>Taylor: I want to learn basic design skills and techniques that can act as the basis or foundation for the way I brand my future business. Design is about people and as I hope to be an event planner, my connection to both is essential.</p>
		<p>Erica: I am interested in exploring the line between non fiction and fiction and seeing how to push the limits of traditional journalism while maintaining authority.</p>
		<p>Latecia: I would like to learn the traditional and non traditional elements of journalism, how to properly structure a layout, as well as the fundamentals of coding.  Hopefully, I will be able to incorporate this functions in my writing and bring them to life.</p>
