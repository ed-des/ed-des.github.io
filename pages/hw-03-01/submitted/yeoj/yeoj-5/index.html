  <h1>Legendary Physicist Freeman Dyson on God, Unanswerable Questions, and Why Diversity Is the Ruling Law of the Universe</h1>

  <p>Freeman Dyson is far more fragile than I thought: a small man in a slightly oversized raincoat, with glasses that seem to date from before World War I. When I meet him in a hotel in Cambridge, England, he carries two unbuttered rolls in one hand and a somewhat feminine umbrella in the other. He immediately reminds you of an absentminded professor. His wife, who has accompanied him, explains that Freeman would forget to eat if someone weren’t around to remind him periodically of the concept of taking food.</p>

    
  <p class=quote>He has found time, next to his impressive career as a physicist working alongside such people as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, Richard Feynman, and Hans Bethe, to raise five daughters and one son. He’s a kind father, that’s plain to see. And he has the most curious smile I’ve come across in years.</p>


  <p2>When he calls an autistic woman he’s known since her childhood the closest thing to an alien intelligence he’s ever come across, I’m struck by the same observation, looking at the man opposite me. Slightly alien, very kind and easygoing, but also rather strange. Spellbindingly strange, and at the same time spellbindingly normal. </p2>
