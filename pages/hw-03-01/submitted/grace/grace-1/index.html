    <h1>The Ones That Got Away</h1>
</div>
    
<div class="partone">
    <p style="color:#b9c5da; padding-top:150px;">You can experience a fling with a city.
    <br>That’s what travel is. Tourism.
    <br>It’s a roller coaster romance —
        <br>that sense of</p>
    <p class="love">falling in love for the first time.</p>
</div>

<div class="parttwo">
    <p>Looking deep into eyes and feeling them look back. Passionate nights exploring new bodies. Listening to the rhythms of a different kind of breath. Sleeping in foreign beds. Embracing the exotic.
    <p><br>You get swept up in the fun. The desire. The infatuation. Everything is new and exciting.</p> 
    <p class="love" style="margin-bottom:150px;">It’s not too different to falling in love.</p>
    <p>Of course, stay and settle in, and you realize you never communicated. <Br>Never really talked. Still don’t know how. All that fun, infatuation, and discovery got in the way. Dive beneath the surface, and you’ll find the things you don’t like.</p>
    <p><Br>But cities won’t apologize for that. Love me or leave me, they say. I don’t care. I never told you I wasn’t any of those things. You just never looked.</p>
    <p><br>And perhaps we’ve all woken up to that sensation, once.</p>
</div>

<div class="partthree">
<p>Sometimes though, a city will carve a path to your heart. It’s flippant. Unintentional. Subtle. The surface is what you expected, and beneath it, more. There’s depth and warmth. <Br> A sense of place. The streets and its people vibrate on your wavelength.</p>
