<h1>It starts when we’re kids.</h1>
<h3>Why did you lie then? </h3>

<div class="because">
        <p style="font-size:18px; padding-bottom: 10px;
">Because you didn’t want to get in trouble; </p>
        <p style="font-size:16px;  padding-bottom: 50px;
">because you cared what the other kids thought;</p>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">because you were afraid to lose the love of your mom. </p>
</div>

    <p class="quote" style="margin-top:200px;">It is the law of obedience which produces the necessity of lying in children</p>

<div class="because">
    <p style="margin-top:-380px; width: 800px;">Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, advising us against making our children fearful.</p>
    <p>But even more than that, I’d argue, it is the need for <em class="love">love.</em></p>
</div>

    <p style="margin-top:400px;">The people who find themselves most betrayed by the <em>lies</em> of lovers <br>are those who have the most unrealistic expectations about <em>truthfulness.</em></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 600px; width:700px;">And the people who are most inclined to believe the <em>lies they shouldn’t</em> <br> are the ones who tell themselves the <em>biggest lie</em> of them all:</p>
    <p class="quote" style="margin-left: 600px; margin-top:0px;">I never tell lies. </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:350px;">If you want to have <em>love</em> in your life, <br> you’d better be prepared to tell some <em>lies</em> <br> and to believe some <em>lies.</em></h2>
    <h2>If <em>honesty</em> is what matters most to you, <br>you might as well embrace a life of <em>silence</em> <br> and become a Trappist monk…. </h2>
    <h4>But most of us do want to love and to be loved.</h4>
    <h3 style="margin-top:-470px;">So what are these lies we should tell and believe?</h3>


<p class="quote" style="margin-top:400px;">Good lovers lie</p>
