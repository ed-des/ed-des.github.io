  <h1>a conversation with<br><span class="Talk">Rob Giampietro </span> </h1>

<h2> Do you have anything you’d say to your younger self <br> when you were starting out? </h2>

<p>  I have two bits of advice for my younger self. First, I didn’t understand until later in my career <strong> how important it is as a designer to listen.</strong> That is the first thing I’d tell myself. At Project Projects, I had phone calls with new clients, and at one point I realized that my desire to please them and show them how much I knew wasn’t as important as allowing them to talk and become intrigued by the mystery of what it would be like for us to work together. Even if I had already started to formulate ideas, I needed to let the person bringing the project to me finish all of their thoughts before I spoke. Listening is so important, and I feel like a lot of new designers don’t understand that. It takes time. </p>

<p> The second bit of advice I’d offer to my younger self is to <strong> be patient with recognition.</strong> It’s important to ask for recognition when you need it and to have good support systems around you, but significant recognition takes a long time to earn and is worth the wait. It’s important to have realistic expectations and not let yourself become prematurely frustrated. </p>
