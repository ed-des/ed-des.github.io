  <h1>Why We Write About Ourselves</h1>

  <p class="bold">There’s a great amount of power present in reading something where the writer is standing right there behind the sentences, saying, “This is true.”</p>

  <p>I aspire to greatness. I want to write literature that moves people, that looks them in the eye and reaches into their guts. My biggest worry is fulfilling the mission of literature, which is to tell us what it means to be human… I’m fueled by the desire to give beauty and truth to the world via the sentences I construct. I really want that in this deep, core, essential way. There’s an ache inside me that’s soothed only by writing.</p>

  <p class="blue">[…]</p>

  <p>I’m not talking about confession. I’m talking about necessity, about telling the deepest truth at the right moment and being in command of that.</p>

  <p class="blue">[…]</p>

  <p>My work doesn’t hinge on shock value. I tell only what needs to be told for the work to reach its full potential. I’m not interested in confession. I’m interested in revelation.</p>

  <p class="blue">[…]</p>

  <p>The most powerful strand in memoir is not expressing your originality. It’s tapping into your universality. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t be original in your writing — you are the only one who can write that universal experience in just that way. Trust that.</p>

  <p class="blue">[…]</p>

  <p class="bold">Good writing is built on craft and heart… You must do your work and it must cost you everything to do it.</p>
