    <h1 class="bg-header">The Meaning of Life</h1>


    <div class="bg-grey">
        <p><span class="small-caps">Human beings </span>are set apart from the animals. We have a <em>spiritual self, a <em>physical</em> self and a <em>conscience.</em></p>
    </div>
    <p class="quote">Therefore, we can make choices and are responsible for the choices we make. We may choose order and peace, or confusion and chaos. </p>

    <div class="bg-grey">
        <p>If we choose the former, we may cultivate and share our talents with others. If we choose the latter, we will isolate and segregate others. We can also expand our vision to include the universe and the diversity of its people, or we can remain narrow and shallow and isolate those who are unfamiliar. </p>
    </div>
    <p>To this day I believe we are here on earth to <span class="small-caps">live, grow up and do</span> what we can to make this world a better place for all people to enjoy freedom. Differences of <span class="small-caps">race, nationality or religion </span>should not be used to deny any human being citizenship rights or privileges. <em>Life is to be lived to its fullest so that death is just another chapter. Memories of our lives, our works and our deeds will continue in others.</em></p>
