  <h1>The Celestine Prophecy</h1>

  <p class="p1">When we dislike someone, or feel threatened by someone, the natural tendency is to focus on something we dislike about the person, something that irritates us. Unfortunately, when we do this--instead of seeing the <span class="deeper"> deeper beauty of the person </span> and giving them energy--we take energy away and actually do them harm. All they know is that they suddenly <span class="less">feel less beautiful and less confident</span>, and it is because we sapped their energy. </p>

  <p class="p2">We must assume every event has significance and contains a message that pertains to our questions...</p>
  <div class="box">
  <div class="bg">
  <p class="p3"> <em>this especially applies to what we used to call bad things...</em></p>
  <p class="p4"> <em>the challenge is to find the silver lining in every event, no matter how negative.</em></p>
