    <p class="p3">If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.</p>
    <p class="p4">Do good anyway.</p>

    <p class="p5">If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.</p>
    <p class="p6">Succeed anyway.</p>

    <p class="p7">The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="p8">Do good anyway.</p>

    <p class="p9">Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="p10">Be honest and frank anyway.</p>

    <p class="p11">The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.</p>
    <p class="p12">Think big anyway.</p>

    <p class="p13">People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.</p>
    <p class="p14">Fight for a few underdogs anyway.</p>

    <p class="p15">What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.</p>

    <p class="p17">People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.</p>
    <p class="p18">Help people anyway.</p>

    <p class="p19">Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.</p>
