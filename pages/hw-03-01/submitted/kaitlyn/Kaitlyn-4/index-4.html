    <h1> <em> i've learned...</em> </h1>
  <p class="em">I've learned</P> that no matter what happens, or how bad it
seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned </P> that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things:
a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll miss them when they're
gone from your life. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that making a living is not the same thing as making a life. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that life sometimes gives you a second chance.<br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both
hands; you need to be able to throw some things back. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually make the right decision. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that every day you should reach out and touch someone. People love a warm hug, or
just a friendly pat on the back. <br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that I still have a lot to learn.<br/><br/><br/>
<p class="em">I've learned</P> that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you
did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. <br/><br/><br/>
