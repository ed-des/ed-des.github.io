<div class="head lead"><p>Helen Rice and Josh Nissenboim are creative directors and co-founders of the award-winning, South Carolina-based creative agency, Fuzzco. They are known for their playful, refined style, and have worked with clients like MailChimp, Google, Slack, Etsy, and Bonobos, among others. They opened up a second office in Portland, Oregon, in 2015 and recently launched Pretend Store, a digital and brick-and-mortar retail offshoot of their studio.<br><span class="line">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p></div></span>

<div class="interview">
<span class="questions"> <p>Tell me about your path to starting Fuzzco together.</p></span>
<p><br><strong>JOSH</strong>: Everything started when Helen and I met in St. Paul, Minnesota, at a small school called Macalester College. I studied math and Helen studied studio art, but we actually met in French class. We became close very quickly and dated throughout college.

<br> When we graduated in 2003, we had to figure out what we were going to do next. I moved to Madison, Wisconsin, and did a lot of different things: recorded an album, worked at a library and a liquor store, then got a job at a software company. Helen joined me in Wisconsin before she and I moved to Charleston together in August 2004.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN</strong>: Part of my senior show in college was making children’s picture books. Josh helped me with the writing and I did the illustrations, and that was kind of our first project together.</p>

<p><br>At the time, we couldn’t find any jobs in Charleston that got us excited. I had been doing some design work, and Josh knew how to build websites, so we said, “Hey, let’s try to do this for people we know in town.”</p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH</strong>: We came up with the name “Fuzzco” in a few hours, and we took shifts working on my old PC from college because we had very little money to work with. After a while, we began to learn a lot, build relationships, and do good work—we were hooked. We probably charged way too little when we started, (laughing) but we said yes to everything for the sake of learning, working, and growing.</p>

<div class="interview">
  <span class="questions"><p>Were either of you working day jobs at the time?</p></span>
<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> Yes, for a few years. I tutored math students in my spare time and did some other weird side jobs until 2007.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> (to Josh) You also had a cab company for a little while.</p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> Right. That was a disaster, but it seemed good on paper. I also day-traded a little bit. I was just messing around, trying to figure out independent ways of surviving. But a few years later, Fuzzco became a viable business. At some point, we found ourselves with a steady flow of work and started winning awards, which we never expected. Clients began reaching out from everywhere, not just down the street, and we gained more momentum.</p>

<p>Then one day in 2008, a designer—this wonderful guy named Mason—strongailed us. The essence of what he said was, “Hey, I want to work with you.” We weren’t hiring, but the way he told us what was going to happen was really charming, and his work was amazing, so we hired him. He’s still a close friend.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> He’s such a weirdo; we just loved him and it felt really natural. When he started, Josh and I were living at our contractor’s house because the renovation on our office/house was several months late. Mason’s very first job was painting the house so we could move in, which took 20 days. (laughing)</p>

<span class="firstappear">. . . </span>
<div class="appear"><p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong>We never thought we’d have a company with strong employees or anything like that when we first started. But once we got into a rhythm, we realized that it was kind of awesome surrounding ourselves with really talented people.So we got hooked on trying to build a team. Over the years, we’ve had some incredible people join us, and we couldn’t be more proud of our team today.</p> </div>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> Another big part of our story is that we’ve moved around Charleston a lot, and our office has been located in maybe six or seven different buildings. Along the way, we’ve been able to renovate and design a lot of our spaces, which references the holistic way we think about our work. It’s not just design and development: it’s about the whole experience. Being able to extend our brand into a space is a big deal to us. It’s been a lot of fun. And about a year ago, we opened our Portland office.</p>

<div class="interview">

  <span class="questions"><p>Did either of your parents run their own businesses or influence you to seek out creative work?</p></span>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> My dad definitely influenced my interest in art. He’s an architect who has always painted and drawn. He encouraged me to be creative, have fun, and draw a lot. My mom was a bookkeeper for a long time, which is very detail-oriented, so she taught me about being thorough.</p>

<p>Neither of my parents worked for themselves while I was growing up, although my mom started working for herself a little bit recently. There wasn’t an impetus for me to go in that direction early on, but Josh is a different story.</p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> My mom is a social worker: she was the director of an adult day care program for people with dementia. As a kid, I sometimes went with her after school and saw her run her office with a few other staff members. She’d let me make myself a cup of instant coffee with three packs of sugar and a bunch of milk, so I’d get a pretty big sugar and caffeine high and hang out with the old people who went there. The people were happy, and I found that amazing to be around as a kid.</p>

<p>Then one day, he quit. I remember feeling like we were barely making it as a family, so this was an exciting time. (laughing) He immediately bought a used truck and a used lawn mower and started cutting grass for people. He has a very loud, unruly personality and his English isn’t very good; but he loved joking around with people who didn’t understand what he was saying—in short, he made a strong impression. When I was growing up, I cut grass with him on weekends and during the summer. We did this for years. I saw firsthand what it was like to work hard to make a living and how important it was to be yourself and create strong relationships with your customers.</p>

<p>I still do my dad’s billing for him every month. He rattles off in Hebrew how many times he cut each person’s grass, while I keep a spreadsheet, do a mail merge, and send the bills to a Kinkos down the street from his house.</p>

<span class="questions"><p>As business partners, is it important for you to have clearly identified roles separate from one another?</p></span>

<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> We struggled with those boundaries for a long time, actually. When it was just the two of us, we found a rhythm. We knew what each of us was best at, but we switched on a project-by-project basis: sometimes I would design when Helen should have been designing, and sometimes Helen would write code when I should have been writing code.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong>I built a lot of Flash websites back in the day. (laughing) We constantly had opinions about what the other one was doing and didn’t always agree, which was stressful, but over time we found a much better dynamic.</p>

<span class="firstappear">. . . </span>
  <div class="appear"><p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> As we’ve grown our team, we’ve learned the importance of each owning our own projects and focusing on our strengths.</p></div>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> Yeah, for the most part we divide and conquer, knowing when to bring the other in for added perspective.</p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> One of us is the lead and makes the final decisions on each project. Establishing that subtle boundary did a lot.</p>

<span class="questions"><p> When you began looking for clients, did you tap into your social networks, or did you actively market yourselves?</p></span>

<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> The first work we found was due to our friends’ willingness to work with us and spread the word. Helen grew up here, so one of our first clients was a textile designer who was also the wife of someone Helen had worked for, and another was an architect that her dad had worked with. The only marketing we did was making some postcards that we mailed and stapled to telephone poles in our neighborhood—but we received a letter from the city asking us to take all of them down or else we’d be fined.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> The timing worked out really well, too. Back in 2005, Charleston was booming, and the beginning of our business coincided with the beginning of a lot of other people’s businesses. We were a scrappy alternative to some of the bigger, more traditional agencies here, so we were met with a lot of opportunities.</p>

<span class="questions"><p>What are some of the greatest benefits and challenges to being an entrepreneurial couple?</p></span>

<p><br><strong>HELEN: </strong>The benefits outweigh any negative associations. We love what we do, so the fact that we work together means that we can work longer and harder, then go home and keep problem-solving. We have the ability to move forward and celebrate together, and when things are hard, we have the ability to lean on each other and have each other’s backs.</p>

<p>The hardest aspect is that it can feel never-ending sometimes. Occasionally, when we go home, we agree to take a night off of talking about work. But, for the most part, we’re on the same page and help each other stay sane. It’s a good thing. </p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH: </strong> A lot of people ask, “How could you possibly run a company with your wife?” But I say, “How could you possibly marry someone you couldn’t run a company with?” (laughing) </p>

<div class="interview">

<p>HELEN: Exactly. We share everything.</p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> If we weren’t running this business together, neither of us would be as fulfilled or as challenged. I believe that being a couple has given us a competitive advantage: we have accomplished more in less time than some other businesses have because Helen and I are in constant communication.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> Right. As a wife, if Josh had to work until midnight, I’d be so upset. But since I’m working with him until midnight, it’s great! (laughing)</p>

<span class="questions"><p>What advice would you give to couples who are considering going into business together?</p></span>

<p><br><strong>JOSH: </strong>This might get weird for a minute: some couples don’t go to the bathroom together.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> (laughing)</p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH:</strong> And that blows my mind! How have you never gone to the bathroom with that other person in the room? What I’m saying is, I believe you need to have an incredibly open and comfortable relationship if you’re going to go into business together.</p>

<p><br><strong>HELEN:</strong> Exactly. You have to be vulnerable and feel like the other person is truly your partner. You need to be aware of avoiding power struggles and making sure each person has their own, defined role. That’s the best way to work together.</p>

<p><br><strong>JOSH: </strong>And when you’re in the bathroom together, you can get some shit done. (laughing)</p>
