    <h1><span class="code">HTML</span> Layout Essentials</h1>
    <p>You already know how to construct a basic <span class="code">HTML</span> page, and how to style the <span class="code">HTML</span> elements using <span class="code">CSS</span>. Now, let’s take a look at how different kinds of elements display in a page layout.</p>

        <h1>1. Text and Elements</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h1>Text</h1>
        <p>Strings of text always appear in an inline flow. That means that every word will appear to the right of the one before it until there is no more space on the line, at which point, the string of text will start again at left side of the line below. Left to right, top to bottom. This is the flow of <em>inline content</em>.</p>
        <p>But raw text alone doesn’t make for a great editorial layout. A good layout, like any web page, needs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Content to be able to be assembled in a variety of  layout orientations, say for example, a grid.</li>
            <li>Content to be visual, interactive, and functional.</li>
        </ol>
        <section class="examples">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>This is the first website, made by Tim Berns-Lee.</p>
            <img class="w-40p" src="images/first_website.jpg">

            <img class="w-40p" src="images/untitled.png">
        </section>
        <p>This is where <em>elements</em> come into play. Today, we are going to focus on how different elements let us layout  an editorial web page in different ways.</p>
    </section>    
    <section>
        <h1>Elements</h1>
        <p>An element is like a container you can put content in. While it’s not possible to give raw text different layout structures, styles, and interactive properties, it's possible to do this with elements that contain text. Moreover, elements can also contain embeddable media and even other elements. In <span class="code">html</span>, an element is anything wrapped in an opening and closing tag.</p>
        <p>Here are a few examples of elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="code">&#60;span&#62;this is a string of text&#60;/span&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;p&#62;this is a string of text&#60;/p&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;div&#62;this is a string of text&#60;/div&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;div&#62;
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>&#60;p&#62;this string of text is a header&#60;/p&#62;</li>
                    <li>&#60;p&#62;this string of text is a paragraph.&#60;/p&#62;</li>
                </ul>
            &#60;/div&#62;
            </li>
            <li class="code">&#60;li&#62;this is a string of text&#60;/li&#62;</li>
        </ul>
        <section class="deepdive">
            <h1>Deep Dive</h1>
            <p>Why would you want to put one element inside another element? Many reasons. One is so that you can group elements together, and then design that group in a certain way. This “Deep Dive” box, for example, puts a header element and a paragraph element in a “parent” container. In CSS, the parent container was given a yellow container.</p>

    <section>
        <h1>Styling Elements</h1>
        <p>When you lay out content, you want to put different kinds of content inside different kinds of elements (between the open and close tags). Why? Different elements have their own default position and style properties.</p>
        <section class="examples">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            I am content not wrapped in its own tag. I have no default properties.
            <br><br>
            <em>I am content wrapped in <span class="code">&#60;em&#62;</span> tags. My font style is italicized by default.</em>
            <h2>I am content wrapped in <span class="code">&#60;h2&#62;</span> tags. My font size is larger and weight bold by default.</h2>
        </section>
        <p>When you wrap content inside a tag, you are also putting that content inside of a “container”. In CSS, you can style that container to have its own fill color, border, and other display properties.</p>
        <section class="examples borders">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            I am content not wrapped in its own tag. I do not live in my own container, and you cannot use CSS to specially style me.
            <br><br>
            <em>I am content wrapped in <span class="code">&#60;em&#62;</span> tags. You can use CSS to, say, add a green border around my “container”.</em>
            <h2>I am content wrapped in <span class="code">&#60;h2&#62;</span> tags. You can use CSS to, say, add a green border around my “container”.</h2>

    <section>
        <h1>The following elements display as <em>Inline</em> elements by default:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="code">&#60;span&#62;&#60;/span&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;a&#62;&#60;/a&#62;</li>

            <li class="code">&#60;em&#62;&#60;/em&#62;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you add inline elements to a page, they will be laid out just like words in a string of text: left-to-right then top-to-bottom.</p>
        <section class="examples borders">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>In this page’s <span class="code">HTML</span>, every word in the sentence below was put inside a <span class="code">&#60;span&#62;</span> (and styled with a green border):</p>

        <section class="deepdive">
            <h1>Deep Dive</h1>
            <p>While you can use CSS to style an inline element’s container in some ways (like adding a green border, for example), you cannot change the container’s width and height or, say, add a top and bottom margin.</p>
            <section class="examples borders">
                <h1>Example</h1>
                <p>The <strong>span</strong> elements below were assigned no width attributes in CSS. Their widths are defined by the length of the content inside them:</p>
                <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span>
                <p>The <strong>span</strong> elements below were assigned width attributes of 1000px each in CSS, which is a LOT. The inline element ignores this. Their widths are <em>still</em> defined by the length of the content inside them:</p>
                <span class="w-1000">I</span> <span class="w-1000">think</span> <span class="w-1000">therefore</span>

        <h1>The following elements display as <em>Block</em> elements by default:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="code">&#60;p&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;h1&#62;&#60;/h1&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;div&#62;&#60;/div&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;ul&#62;&#60;/ul&#62;</li>
            <li class="code">&#60;li&#62;&#60;/li&#62;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you add block elements to a page, they will stack top-to-bottom. Each element will stretch horizontally to take up its own entire line. Thus, other inline or block content cannot appear to the left or right of the block element.</p>
        <section class="examples borders">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>In this page’s HTML, every word in the sentence was put inside a <span class="code">&#60;div&#62;</span> (and styled with a green border):</p>

        <section class="deepdive">
            <h1>Deep Dive</h1>
            <p>A block element is better at adopting “physical”-like properties. You can use CSS to change the container’s width and height, or, say, add a top and bottom margin.</p>
            <section class="examples borders">
                <h1>Example</h1>
                <p>The first <strong>div</strong> element below was given no width, so it fills 100% of its parent container, by default. The second was given a 40% width in CSS to fill 40% of its parent container. The third was given a 100px width in CSS.</p>
                <div>I</div> <div class="w-40p">think</div> <div class="w-100">therefore</div>
                <p>Note: even when there is enough horizontal room for two block elements to fit side by side, they will still  stack one on top of the other.</p>

        <h1>You can make an element whose default state displays <em>inline</em> instead display as a <em>block</em> element (and vice versa)</h1>
        <p>In CSS, add the <strong class="code">display: block;</strong> attribute to what would otherwise be an inline element, and the <strong class="code">display: inline;</strong> attribute to what would otherwise be a block element.</p>
        <section class="examples borders">

        <h1>3. Aligning Inline & Block Elements</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Say you want to align the content on your page. By default, all content is left-aligned. Beyond that...</p>
    <section>
        <h1>For inline content</h1>
        <p>To align an inline element: you can give its parent container an attibute that aligns everything inside the parent left, center, or right.</p>
        <section class="examples borders">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>The example below shows two text sentences. Each sentence is contained in an inline, <span class="code">span</span> element. Both span elements are contained in a parent <span class="code">div</span> element. I gave the parent <span class="code">div</span> the style attribute of <span class="code">text-align: center;</span>. This centers both inline <span class="code">span</span> elements in the parent.</p>
            <div class="center-items">
                <span class="span-box">I am.</span> 
                <span class="span-box">You are.</span> 
            </div>
        </section>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>For block elements</h1>
        <p>To align a block element: you can give the element itself an attribute that tells it how it should align itself on the page. One common objective is centering a block element. This can be done by setting its left and right margins to "auto" (e.g. <span class="code">margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;</span>)</p>
        <section class="examples borders">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>The example below shows one sentence. The sentence is contained in a block, <span class="code">div</span> element. (Because it is a block element, I could set a width and height for it). I gave it the style attribute of <span class="code">margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;</span>. As a result, it centers itself in its parent.</p>
            <div class="div-center">I think therefore I am.</div>
            <p>What if I wanted to the raw text inside the <span class="code">div</span>to be text-aligned center? In that case, you can think of the <span class="code">div</span> as a parent element for the inline text content. I gave the <span class="code">div</span> the style attribute of <span class="code">text-align: center;</span>. Now, the <span class="code">div</span> is both centering itself in its own parent, and it is centering all inline text inside it.</p>
            <div class="div-center center-items">I think therefore I am.</div>

    </section>
    <section>
        <h1>Floating elements</h1>
        <p>There is another way to align block and inline elements to the left or right. You can give the element the style attribute of <span class="code">float: left</span> or <span class="code">float: right</span>. This aligns it to the left or right side within its parent element. Giving an element the float attribute also does a couple other things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>While it will keep its original vertical position on the page, it will force itself to the right or left side of its own container, no matter what other elements, inline or block, are next to or below it.</li>
            <li>While it will not overlap with sibling inline elements, it will overlap with sibling block elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <section class="examples borders">
            <h1>Example</h1>
            <p>Here's that earlier example, where every word in the sentence below was put inside a <span class="code">&#60;span&#62;</span>, an inline element. Only this time, I made one of the elements green:</p>
            <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span class="pre-float">think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span>
            <p>Now, let’s give that green <span class="code">&#60;span&#62;</span> a <span class="code">&#60;float: right;&#62;</span> style attribute. When it forces itself to the right, other inline elements flow around it:</p>
            <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span class="pre-float float-right">think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span> <span>I</span> <span>think</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>I</span> <span>am</span>

            <div>I</div> <div>think</div> <div>therefore</div> <div>I</div> <div>am</div> <div>I</div> <div class="pre-float">think</div> <div>therefore</div> <div>I</div> <div>am</div> <div>I</div> <div>think</div> <div>therefore</div> <div>I</div> <div>am</div>
            <p>Let us float that green element to the right. Let's increase its height, too. When it forces itself to the right, other block elements overlap behind it:</p>
            <div>I</div> <div>think</div> <div>therefore</div> <div>I</div> <div>am</div> <div>I</div> <div class="pre-float float-right h-100">think</div> <div>therefore</div> <div>I</div> <div>am</div> <div>I</div> <div>think</div> <div>therefore</div> <div>I</div> <div>am</div>
