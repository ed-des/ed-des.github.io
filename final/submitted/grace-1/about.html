    <p>Upon reading the article, “Four Centuries of Book Titles,” I was fascinated to learn about the making of book titles, and how that has its own process or history apart from the content of the book. However, it was a bit disappointing to see that there was no particular treatment to highlight the array of titles discussed in the essay. Rather, the titles were all cluttered and mixed throughout the essay, making the reading experience somewhat dry. As such, I am proposing to create a mobile app that would generate and provide a context to how the titles came to be. This would be accomplished by scanning the title page of a given book, which would then trigger the app to generate an audio file that recites the information and/or fun facts about the title of the book. As an added feature, the app can also generate a gallery of titles pages from similar time period or with similar themes. Users can also log their scanned pages, bookmark their favorite titles or podcasts, and create and submit their own titles. </p>

    <div class="title" id="sub" style="color:#85738c;">Parts Over Space</div>
    <p>In theory, all the information already exists in the infinite digital database. It is the matter of scanning the right title page that the mobile app would extract the relevant information from the database. Users can only log and bookmark books they already scanned, and can only expand their collection by finding and scanning more books first!</p>
