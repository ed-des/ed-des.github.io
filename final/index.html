            <h2>Expanding our notion of screen.</h2>
            <p>Up until now, we have employed the web as a playground for a broader inquiry into deeper editorial design concepts, including: interaction, narrative, identity, adaptivity, serialization, time, and access. Now, let’s look beyond the web. How can we employ these same concepts in the design of editorial experiences that expand our notion of the screen? Here are few examples to draw on. What are their objectives? Where do they succeed? Where do they fail?</p>

            <p class="example-item" id="scroll-style">“Much of my own walking and writing in Rome centered on these elements that highlight a connection between the city and its technologies of representation. At the Palazzo Valentini you can walk into a space layered with four major moments in Roman history, from an ancient bath complex to a fascist bunker, all of which is experienced using glass floors, animated renderings, and projected choreographed digital effects. Here the digital invokes the ancient. The Vatican Map Room, a hallway covered with floor-to-ceiling frescoes, was the immersive Google Maps of its day. Renaissance artists were constantly trying to innovate techniques that transformed one material into another—glass into light, stone into flesh—in a way that makes the digital/analog divide seem quaint. And Rome has been continuously inhabited for so long that technological innovations, along with the social questions that arise as a result of those innovations, basically come with the territory.” <span>—Rob Giampietro, <a href="http://risdmuseum.org/manual/410_building_a_bigger_picture_an_interview_with_rob_giampietro_of_google_design_ny" target="_blank">Building a Bigger Picture</a></span></p>

            <br><br><em>The way books are written has changed.</em>
            <br><em>The canvas for books has changed.</em>
            <br><em>The post-published life of a book has changed.</em>
            <br><br>“To think about the future of the book is to understand the links between these changes […] These connections shaping books and publishing live in emergent systems behind the words. Between the writing and the publishing, publishing and consuming, consuming and sharing.
            <br><br>“We have an opportunity now to shape these systems. And in doing so, to refine the relationships between authors, publishers, readers and texts.” <span>—Craig Mod, <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/" target="_blank">Post-Artifact Books and Publishing</a></span></p>

            <h2>The final project.</h2>
            <p>You will design and edit an article as a unique editorial experience for the screen.</p>

                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p>Choose one of the publication articles below. Reimagine it as a serialized story, then design a new way for the reader of tomorrow to access and read it. Serialize it in one of the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parts Over Time. </strong>All published for the same screen format, but with parts launched at different times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parts Over Space. </strong>All made available at the same time, but with parts published in different places, i.e. on different “screens” suitable to those places.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="step-item" id="scroll-style">
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>To complete this design assignment, you must address the following challenges.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Editorial. </strong>Think of the original article as raw material. Take editorial license (cut, add, and reorganize content) to serve the reader experience you wish to design, and present it as though fresh and relevant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audience. </strong>Know who your audience is, and why your article is valuable to them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access. </strong>Not only are you designing the article’s reader experience. You are designing the user experience, i.e. reimagining how a user discovers/accesses/browses articles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity System. </strong>What editorial identity unifies the article parts of the whole across time/space?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="step-item" id="scroll-style">
                <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Mockups of the Full Article.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Mockups of the UX. </strong>Demonstrate how it is accessed and used in context.</li>
                <li><strong>Writeup. </strong>Introduce your concept, and explain how your design tackled all of the challenges specified.</li>
                <li><strong>Web Presentation. </strong>A mobile- and desktop-optimized web article to formally present your work (i.e. the mockups and writeup).</li>
                <li><strong>Context Colophon. </strong>The web presentation should include a section at the end that indicates what the assignment is, what class it is for, the semester/year/instructor, and the source material you drew on.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Ideate – due 4/19. </strong>Choose an article. As you read it, draft several themes and visuals that come to mind. Sketch 3 ideas for what your final project could be.</li>
                <li><strong>Rough Draft – due 4/26. </strong>Present a first, rough draft of your mockups and an outline of your write-up.</li>
                <li><strong>Clean Draft – due 5/3. </strong>Present a clean-but-rough-around-the-edges draft of your mockups and write-up.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Final – due 5/10. </strong>Present the final version of everything for the final crit.</li>
                <li><strong>Submit Final – due 5/17. </strong></li>
