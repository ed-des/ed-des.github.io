		<div class="grp-parent">
			<div class="grp-child-50">
				<p class="led">This course aims to prepare journalists and writers with the basics of visual and interaction design for modern-day journalism. It is part studio, part seminar, including light reading, many little assignments, and one large final project.</p>

		<div class="grp-parent">
			<div class="grp-child-50">
				<p><span class="diamond"></span><strong>Part 1 – Foundation.</strong> We will begin by experimenting with form through typography, dynamic composition, and basic paragraph layout. We will also learn how to find and choose fonts, and use core tools including Illustrator and InDesign.</p>

				<p><span class="diamond"></span><strong>Part 2 – Article Layout.</strong> We will learn to design more complicated editorial layouts – this time, for web. We will explore articles of different shapes and functions; we will learn the value of different web article components; and we will practice making meaningful stories using multiple and interactive forms of media. To do this, we will learn to write basic HTML and CSS code.</p>

		<div class="grp-parent">
			<div class="grp-child-50">
				<p><span class="diamond"></span><strong>Part 3 – Ecosystem.</strong> We will learn how a web article fits into a larger product ecosystem, including its parent website and/or whatever channels of access it relies upon. We will blur the boundaries between reader experience and user experience, and learn how to design a publication with brand identity and distribution models in mind. To do this, will learn how to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes, and how to share and discuss our big ideas in team environments.</p>

			<h1>Outcomes & Grading</h1>
		</header>
		<div class="grp-parent">
			<div class="grp-child-50">
				<h1>Learning Outcomes.</h1>
				<p>Foundational type and design skills. A knowledge of the discipline and its history. Proficiency with professional design tools and resources, from Creative Suite to HTML/CSS. The ability to design a successful layout for different reading contexts. An understanding of how these foundational design skills apply to today’s journalism landscape. A process that allows you to make with form and content side-by-side. An ability to think critically about all things design (and all things not design :) An understanding of the different designer skill sets and roles at play in the industry. Strong communication skills when presenting work, and the ability to collaborate creatively with others.</p> 
				<h1>Final Grade Calculation.</h1>
				<p>Your grade will be based on: your participation in class and completion of assignments; your overall level of engagement; the quality of your work – both the successes and failures; your communication/presentation skills; your attention to detail.</p></br>
				<ul>
					<li>Participation: 25%</li>
					<li>Assignments: 45%</li>
					<li>Final: 30%</li>
				</ul>
				<h1>Grading Standards.</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>A [4.0; 96–100%]: Work of exceptional quality, which often goes beyond the stated goals of the course </li>
					<li>A- [3.7; 91 –95%]: Work of very high quality</li><li>B+ [3.3; 86–90%]: Work of high quality that indicates substantially higher than average abilities</li>
					<li>B [3.0; 81–85%]: Very good work that satisfies the goals of the course</li>
					<li>B- [2.7; 76–80%]: Good work</li>
					<li>C+ [2.3; 71–75%]: Above-average work</li>
					<li>C [2.0; 66–70%]: Average work that indicates an understanding of the course material; passable </li>
					<li>Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of C or higher.</li>
					<li>C- [1.7; 61–65%]: Passing work but below good academic standing</li>
					<li>D [1.0; 46–60%]: Below-average work that indicates a student does not fully understand the assignments; </li>
					<li>Probation level though passing for credit</li>
					<li>F [0.0; 0–45%]: Failure, no credit</li>
					<li>Grade of W: The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript. A grade of W may also be issued by an instructor to a graduate student (except at Parsons and Mannes) who has not completed course requirements nor arranged for an Incomplete.</li>
					<li>Grade of WF: The grade of WF is issued by an instructor to a student (all undergraduates and all graduate students) who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade. The WF is equivalent to an F in calculating the grade point average (zero grade points), and no credit is awarded.</li>
					<li>Grade of Incomplete: The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations</li>
					<li>Undergraduate students: Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “WF” by the Office of the Registrar.</li>

			<h1>School Policies</h1>
		</header>
		<div class="grp-parent">
			<div class="grp-child-50">
				<h1>Responsibility.</h1>
				<p>Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course. </p>
				<h1>Participation.</h1>
				<p>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time. </p>
				<h1>Attendance.</h1>
				<p>Parsons’ attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students’ success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus. <br></p><p>While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.</p>
				<p>Whether the course is a lecture, seminar or studio, faculty will assess each student’s performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining the student’s final grade.</p>
				<h1>Blackboard or Canvas.</h1>
				<p>Use of Blackboard may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.</p>
				<h1>Delays.</h1>
				<p>In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class. If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival. In the event that I will miss class entirely, a sign will be posted at the classroom indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.</p>
				<h1>Electronic Devices.</h1>
				<p>The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course’s work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.</p>
				<h1>Student Disability Services (SDS).</h1>
				<p>In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the Office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me. SDS assists students with disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>
				<p>For more, see: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/" target="_blank">Student Disability Services</a></p>
				<h1>Adacemic Honesty and Integrity.</h1>
				<p>The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the ParsonsCatalog.</p>
				<p>It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university. For more, see: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/provost/academic-honesty-and-integrity-policy.pdf" target="_blank">Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy.pdf</a></p>
