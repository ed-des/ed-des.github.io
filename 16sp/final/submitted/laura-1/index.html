  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>In the summer of 1970, the residents of a West Side apartment building gather to form a rooftop collective in protest of a price raise on the laundry room washing machines. As the residents become engaged in an ongoing dialogue within their building, other cooperatives spring up, including ones for gardening, baby-sitting, dressmaking, can repair etc. A flourishing sense of community emerges from this mundane act of drying laundry together with oneâ€™s neighbors on the roof.</p>
  <p>Focusing on that idea of human connection, I present a new reading experience for this article in which the anecdotes of featured residents are strung together on a clothesline. Expressive or striking quotes pulled from the vignettes serve as the primary text. The novelty of this experience lies in its cinematic quality and its exploration of how text is mapped onto objects and surfaces.</p>
