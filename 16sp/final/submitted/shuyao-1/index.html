<h1><span>MODERN<br>MECHANIX</span><br>THE NEW STEAM ENGINE CAR <br>COMING BACK</h1>

  <span>/<br><br>What can designers do nowadays to create new reading experience, even if from text written in the past?</span>
<br><br><br>
Inspired by the article <em>‘Steam Car is Coming Back!’</em>, published on Modern Mechanix and Inventions in 1960’s, I turned the reading experience of the text into a engagement campaign piece. Supposedly steam car is coming back to our present or near future society, introduced by the innovative technology company Modern Mechanix, as a more efficient and environmentally friendly technology that targeting people working in the city/urban area, and publicize it, is my mission here.
<br><br>
I designed a street projection installation, that projects different features of the steam car engine in different blocks of the city. The projection should be immersive, and intriguing enough for people to walk into it, and engage with it.
<br><br>
The projection on the street is the clip of a steam car driving by, and it drives along with the actual cars on the street, so that people would have an experience from the past as well as the present. As for the projection on the side buildings / walls are the specific feature that is featured in the block.

<p>
  <span>/<br><br>What comes after the audience approached the site?</span>
  <br><br>
  Since people nowadays in the cities are living in fast paces, and a mobile reading experience is a lot more accessible and friendly for most of the audience.
  <br><br>
  There will be QR codes that link people to the mobile site of the campaign, and by snapping the code, people will have access to more information about what is being featured about the engine on the street.

<div class="stitle3">|<br>READ<br>MORE?</div>
<section class="rm">
<div>
  <span>/<br><br>What if you would like to know more?</span>
<p>
  The first thing people would read about when they landed on the mobile site is the detailed information about the feature that is being projected in the street. There are 4 major features, “Boiler supplied hot coffee”, “Starts in 30 seconds”, “Fuel cost but $.017 per mile”and “Bodies can be easily streamlined”. Therefore, after people finished scrolling through the article, there will be two more things to see, “Read More” and “Join the List”.
<br><br>
“Read More” will lead the user to the map page that indicates where other installations are in the city and all over the world, and “Join the List” will link people to the purchase waitlist sign up site, only if they are interested in the product. People can go back to the home page whenever they feel like, and they will still have the access to the options on the home page.

  <span>—</span>
    <br>
    <br>
  <p>
    The reason why I consider this proposal valid and unique is because it was a relatively huge leap from an old magazine to an installation piece that engages with the environment directly. It is also site specific that encourages people to engage with the city and outdoor more, which is exactly the original spirit of a vehicle, takes people further, to explore more about the world they are living in.
<br><br>
    This was an interesting experience for me as well, to take the essence of an editorial piece out of it, and really push it to a new concept, which gives me a new interpretation of editorial design. I wish in the future I could actually have chance to do something as bold as this proposal.
