            <p class="glow1 inside">Books used to be made out of paper. Made by anything from animal skin, to vellum, to plants along the roads. Paper was easily destroyed. People’s information and knowledge were lost from the world due to those unfortunate moments where paper was torn or burnt. Our history is not completed because it went into the air with those paper.</p>

They often got an injury called “the papercut.” This led to further infections, putting their lives even more at risk.</p>

            <p class="glow3 inside2"> There were only two ways that the people in the past can record their place in the book. One was to use a rectangular 2" x 7" piece of thick paper called  “the bookmark.” Bookmarks were dangerous pieces of paper, often times decorated. But they were very frequently misplaced, falling out of books and pockets.</p>
