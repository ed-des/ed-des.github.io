      <p class="when_I_went">When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down <em>‘happy’</em>. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them,</p>

      <p class="man_often">Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, <span class="if"><strong> if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it</span></strong> even if I may not have it at the beginning.</p>

    <div class="description_d">
    <p class="description"> I combined the two quotes from John Lennon and Mahatma Gandhi. Even though they were said by different people with different thoughts, I thought it could be read as one. So I didn’t mix or fragment the order of the writings. I tried to give enough spaces in between the sentences for Gandhi’s quote in order to treat it like a poem while I composed John Lennon’s childhood story in one page in the beginning.</p>
