<H1>The Hidden Meaning of Poetry and Scripture</H1>
<p class="hello1">"Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing;</p> 
<p class="hello3">nor upon tradition;</p> 
<p class="hello4">nor upon rumor;</p> 
<p class="hello6">nor upon what is in a scripture;</p>
<p class="hello7"> nor upon surmise;</p> 
<P class="hello8">nor upon an axiom;</P>
<P class="hello9">nor upon specious reasoning; </P>
<P class="hello10">nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; </P>
<P class="hello11">nor upon another’s seeming ability; </P>
<P class="hello12">nor upon the consideration, </P>
<P class="hello13">“The monk is our teacher.” But when you yourselves know: “These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness,” enter on and abide in them."</p>

<p class="hello14"> "I came out of that spoken-word poetry class one day and realized this was the happiest I’d been all week.<P>

<p class="hello17">around them and they’re wrestling with identity and they’re wrestling with what adults are throwing at them — all of that makes me the most charged up, and I wondered how I could possibly find a way to do that more often and to spend more of my time in that space, in that challenge. So my real choice when I was graduating college wasn’t between becoming a consultant or giving being a professional poet a shot — it was about giving, basically, being an arts educator a shot."</p>
