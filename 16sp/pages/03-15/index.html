			<h1>03-15: Visual Design and Personality</h1>
		</header>
        <p>In the introduction of <em>Designing the Editorial Experience</em>, the authors Juliette Cezar and Sue Apfelbaum ask:</p>
            <p class="quote">But what is a magazine, newspaper, or journal in an era where the form reading takes is not tied to a single medium such as paper? Is a magazine defined by its physical properties or by its content? Is a blog any different from an online magazine? And if we were to decide that a magazine or newspaper is something that exists in print only, what would we call the periodical reading experience being created for the web or or devices such as smartphones and tablets?</p>
            <p>Today, writers, editors, designers, publishers, artists, storytellers, business strategists, entrepreneurs, and just about everyone are trying to figure that out (along with what their respective roles are in this ever-evolving space). While the rules of the game may be changing, some of the game pieces seem to maintain a spot on the board: content, format, distribution, identity, storytelling...</p>
            <p>Another way of posing the question our class is asking is: how as designers can we be empowered to design editorial content, format, identity, even the stories themselves, whatever the rules of the game? While on the one hand, this task may rely on a clear understanding of the technology of the day, it also relies on an understanding of the different components of an editorial experience, and what they alone and together are capable achieving for readers/users.</p>
            <p>Today, we will focus on the following game piece: <strong>personality</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the role of personality in an editorial experience?</li>
                <li>What is the place of personality in today’s screen-based landscape?</li>
                <li>What are techniques for designing with personality in a web article layout?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s kick things off with our Group 1 Discussion: <a href="presentation/index.html" target="_blank">What is the role of “personality” in editorial?</a></p>

			<h1>Workshop: Personality in an Editorial Layout</h1>
		</header>
            <p>Certainly, a publisher’s logo and overall brand identity system play a foundational role in building personality. But today, we are going to focus on basic ways of infusing personality in a single layout of an editorial piece. We’ll cover a few things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Article Anatomy</li>
                <li>Media Query for Responsive Layout</li>
                <li>Embedding Graphics (w/ Images and SVGs)</li>
                <li>A few useful CSS transitions</li>
            </ul>
