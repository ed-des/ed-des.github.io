  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <div class="bott">
    <p>Direct experience comes from nature and man interacting with each other. In this interaction, human energy gathers, is released, dammed up, <span class="cap">frustrated and victorious</span>. There are rhythmic beats of want and fulfillment, pulses of doing and being withheld from doing.</p>

    <p>All interactions that effect stability and order in the whirling flux of change are rhythms. There is ebb and flow, systole and diastole: ordered changeâ€¦ <em>Contrast of lack and fullness, of struggle and achievement, of adjustment after consummated irregularity, form the drama in which action, feeling, and meaning are one.</em> The outcome is balance and counterbalance.</p>
