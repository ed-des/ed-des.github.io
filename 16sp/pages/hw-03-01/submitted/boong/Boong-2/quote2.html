      Simplicity is the highest goal, achievable when you have overcome all difficulties. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is <span class="blue">simplicity</span> that emerges as the crowning reward of art.
    </p>

      When one does a thing, it appears good, otherwise one would not write it. Only later comes <span class="blue">reflection</span>, and one discards or accepts the thing. <span class="blue">Time is the best censor</span>, and patience a most excellent teacher.
    </p>

      Put all your <span class="blue">soul</span> into it, play the way you feel<span class="blue">!</span>

      <em>I wish I could throw off the thoughts which poison my happiness. And yet I take a kind of pleasure in indulging them.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I can only <strong>groan</strong>, <strong>suffer</strong>, and pour out my <strong>despair</strong> at the piano!
