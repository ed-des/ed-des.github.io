  <h1>Becoming...</h1>

  <p class="p2">Your beliefs become your thoughts,</p>
  <p class="p3">Your thoughts become your words,</p>
  <p class="p4">Your words become your actions,</p>
  <p class="p5">Your actions become your habits,</p>
  <p class="p6">Your habits become your values,</p>
  <p class="p7">Your values become your destiny. </p>

  <p class="p1">Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning. </p>
