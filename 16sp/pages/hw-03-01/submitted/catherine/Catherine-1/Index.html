  <h1>Only once in your life,</h1>

  <p class="p1">I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more.</p>
  <p class="p2">...</p>
  <p class="p3">Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because <em> <span class="em">they love you for who you are.</span></em></p>
  <p class="p4">...</p>
  <p class="p5">In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.</p>
