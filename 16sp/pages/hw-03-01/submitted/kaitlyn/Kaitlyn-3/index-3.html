    <h1>  Oh, <br>
    The Places <br>
    You'll Go!</h1>
  </span></div>
<p>"Congratulations!<br/>
Today is <i>your</i> day.<br/>
You're off to Great Places!<br/>
You're off and away!</p>

<p>You have brains in your head.<br/>
You have feet in your shoes.<br/>
You can steer yourself<br/>
<i>any</i> direction you choose.<br/>
You're on your own. And you know what you know.<br/>
And <i>YOU</i> are the guy who'll decide where to go.</p>

<p>You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.<br/>
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."<br/>
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet,<br/>
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.</p>

<p>And you may not find any<br/>
you'll want to go down.<br/>
In that case, of course,<br/>
you'll head straight out of town.</p>

<div class="bg-air"><p class="blue">It's opener there<br/>
in the wide open air.</p>
</div>

<p>Out there things can happen<br/>
and frequently do<br/>
to people as brainy<br/>
and footsy as you.</p>

<p>And then things start to happen,<br/>
don't worry. Don't stew.<br/>
Just go right along.<br/>
You'll start happening too.</p>

<p>OH!<br/>
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!"<br/>
-Dr. Seuss</p>
