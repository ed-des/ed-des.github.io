  <h1> Forgive. Forget. <span style="future; color:#bc8f8f; ">Forward.</span><h1>
<p>“I don't know <br/>if I continue, even today, always liking myself. But what I learned <br/>to do many years ago was to forgive myself. It is very important for every human being to forgive herself or himself because if you live, you will make mistakes- it is inevitable. But once you do and you see the mistake, then you forgive yourself and say, 'Well, <br/>if I'd known better I'd have done better,' that's all. So you say to people who you think you may have injured, 'I'm sorry,' and then you say to yourself, 'I'm sorry.' <br/>If we all hold on to the mistake, <br/>we can't see our own glory in <br/>the mirror because we have the mistake between our faces and <br/>the mirror; we can't see what we're capable of being. You can ask forgiveness of others, but in the end the real forgiveness is in one's own self. I think that young men and women are so caught by the way they see themselves. <br/>Now mind you. When a larger society sees them as unattractive, as threats, as too black or too white or too poor or too fat or <br/>too thin or too sexual or too asexual, that's rough. But you can overcome that. <span style="real; color:#4d1933;">The real difficulty is to overcome how you think about yourself. </span> If we don't have that we never grow, we never learn, and sure as hell we should never teach.”<br/>
