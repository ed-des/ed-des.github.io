<div class="hello">

<p >"In my youth, I traveled much, and I observed in different countries,</p>
</div>

<div class="hello1">
<p>that the more public provisions were made for the poor, 
</p>
</div>

<div class="hello2">
<p>the less they provided for themselves, 
</div>

<div class="hello3">
<p> and of course became poorer.
</p>
</div>

<div class="hello4">
<p> And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer.
</p>
</div>

<div class="hello5">
<p> the more they did for themselves, 
</p>
</div>

<div class="hello6">
<p> and became richer.
