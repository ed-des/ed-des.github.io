    <h1>An Antidote to the Age of <span class="anxiety">Anxiety</span>: </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Alan Watts on Happiness and How to Live with Presence</p>
    
    <p>If to enjoy even an enjoyable present we must have the assurance of a happy future, we are <em>“crying for the moon.”</em> We have no such assurance. The best predictions are still matters of probability rather than certainty, and to the best of our knowledge every one of us is going to suffer and die. If, then, we cannot live happily without an assured future, we are certainly not adapted to living in a finite world where, despite the best plans, accidents will happen, and where death comes at the end.</p>
<div class="bg-grey">
    <p class="quote">The <em>“primary consciousness,”</em> the basic mind which knows reality rather than ideas about it, does not know the future. It lives completely in the present, and perceives nothing more than what is at this moment. The ingenious brain, however, looks at that part of present experience called memory, and by studying it is able to make predictions. These predictions are, relatively, so accurate and reliable (e.g., <em>“everyone will die”</em>) that the future assumes a high degree of reality — so high that the present loses its value.</p>
</div>
    <p>But the future is still not here, and cannot become a part of experienced reality until it is present. Since what we know of the future is made up of purely abstract and logical elements — inferences, guesses, deductions — it cannot be eaten, felt, smelled, seen, heard, or otherwise enjoyed.<span class="highlight">To pursue it is to pursue a constantly retreating phantom, and the faster you chase it, the faster it runs ahead.</span>This is why all the affairs of civilization are rushed, why hardly anyone enjoys what he has, and is forever seeking more and more. Happiness, then, will consist, not of solid and substantial realities, but of such abstract and superficial things as promises, hopes, and assurances.</p>
