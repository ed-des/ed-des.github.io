    <h1>The Most Beautiful Theory</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Physicist Carlo Rovelli on the Aesthetic Enchantment and Scientific Impact of Einstein’s Relativity</p>
    <span class= "quotemarks1">"</span>
    <p>The source of Einstein’s genius as revealed by that theory is among the septet of scientific cornerstones which Italian theoretical physicist and writer Carlo Rovelli illuminates in his slim and stimulating Seven Brief Lessons on Physics (public library).</p>
    <p>Rovelli writes of Einstein’s seminal masterwork:</p>
    <p>There are absolute masterpieces that move us intensely: Mozart’s Requiem, Homer’s Odyssey, the Sistine Chapel, King Lear. To fully appreciate their brilliance may require a long apprenticeship, but the reward is sheer beauty — and not only this, but the opening of our eyes to a new perspective upon the world. Einstein’s jewel, the general theory of relativity, is a masterpiece of this order.</p>
    <p>I remember the excitement I felt when I began to understand something about it. It was summer. I was on a beach at Condofuri in Calabria, immersed in the sunshine of the Hellenic Mediterranean, and in the last year of my university studies. Undistracted by schooling, one studies best during vacations. I was studying with the help of a book that had been gnawed at the edges by mice because at night I’d used it to block the holes of these poor creatures in the rather dilapidated, hippie-ish house on an Umbrian hillside where I used to take refuge from the tedium of university classes in Bologna. Every so often I would raise my eyes from the book and look at the glittering sea: it seemed to me that I was actually seeing the curvature of space and time imagined by Einstein. As if by magic: as if a friend were whispering into my ear an extraordinary hidden truth, suddenly raising the veil of reality to disclose a simpler, deeper order. Ever since we discovered that Earth is round and turns like a mad spinning-top, we have understood that reality is not as it appears to us: every time we glimpse a new aspect of it, it is a deeply emotional experience. Another veil has fallen.</p>
    
    <p><em>Throughout this experiment, one simple mission has inspired us: <strong>to wade into the ethical mire that design, and every act of human intention, draws us into.</strong> Considering the broad influence of design on the world and the contemporary pace of innovation — requiring continuous alterations and adaptations — design shoulders a heavy, yet shadowy responsibility. It needs to be brought into the light and grappled with. This project is our attempt.</em></p>
