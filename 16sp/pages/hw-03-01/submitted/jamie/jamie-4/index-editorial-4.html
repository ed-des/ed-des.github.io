    <h1>Design and Violence</h1>
    <p class="subtitle"> An Intelligent Invitation to Nuanced Discourse in a Culture of Black-and-White Binaries</p>
    <p class= "quotemarks">"</p>
    <p><strong>I</strong>nspired in large part by Harvard psycholinguist Stephen Pinker’s controversial assertion that, statistically speaking, violence has declined over time, Antonelli and Hunt instead argue that violence has mutated rather than subsided — we have moved from more visceral forms of violence, like public executions and the legal impunity for wife-killers, to less visible but no less pernicious manifestations, ranging from cyberattacks to environmental destruction to the devastating injustice of a criminal justice system that renders black men six times more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers.</p>
    <p>Antonelli and Hunt write in the introduction:</p>
    <p><em>Not only does violence appear to be morphing, but how we experience, perceive, and assess it is also shifting. </em> </p>
    <p class="dots">[…]</p>
    <p><em>Where there is transformation, there is design: indeed, the reshaping of everyday experience is at the core of the designer’s work… [But] design’s history of violence, unless linked overtly to political and social suppression, too often goes unexplored.</em></p>
    <p class="dots">[…]</p>
    <p><em>Throughout this experiment, one simple mission has inspired us: <strong>to wade into the ethical mire that design, and every act of human intention, draws us into.</strong> Considering the broad influence of design on the world and the contemporary pace of innovation — requiring continuous alterations and adaptations — design shoulders a heavy, yet shadowy responsibility. It needs to be brought into the light and grappled with. This project is our attempt.</em></p>
