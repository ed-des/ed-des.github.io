<h1>Guilt and Responsibility</h1>

<h2> No, I mean the recognition of where one finds one’s self in time or history or now. I mean the recognition. After all, I’m not guiltless, either. I sold my brothers for my sisters —</h2>

<h3> I will <em>not</em>  accept any guilt for what anybody else did. I will accept guilt for what I did myself.</h3>

<h2> We both have produced, all of us have produced, a system of reality which we cannot in any way whatever control; what we call history is perhaps a way of avoiding responsibility for what has happened, is happening, in time. </h2>
