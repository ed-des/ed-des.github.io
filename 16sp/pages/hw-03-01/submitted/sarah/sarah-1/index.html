<h4> Theory:  </h4>

<div class="bg-blue">
<p>It’s a moment of <strong> enlightenment </strong>. A momentous simplification of the world: space is no longer something distinct from matter — it is one of the <span class="italics"> material </span> components of the world. An entity that undulates, flexes, curves, twists. We are not contained within an invisible, rigid infrastructure: we are immersed in a gigantic, flexible snail shell. The sun bends space around itself, and Earth does not turn around it because of a mysterious force but because it is racing directly in a space that inclines, like a marble that rolls in a funnel. There are no mysterious forces generated at the center of the funnel; it is the curved nature of the walls that causes the marble to roll. Planets circle around the sun, and things fall, because space curves.</p>
