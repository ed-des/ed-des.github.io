    <em style="float:left; font-family:'Contrail One', cursive;">The Art of Asking</em>
    <br style="line-height:10em;">
    <p>And the media asked</p>
    <h1>Amanda, the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy. How did you make all these people pay for music?</h1>
    <p>And the real answer is</p>
    <h1><em>I didn't make them. I asked them.</em><br>And through the very act of asking people, I'd connected with them, and when you connect with them, people want to help you.</h1>
    <h1>It's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists. <br><em>They don't want to ask for things. But it's not easy. It's not easy to ask. And a lot of artists have a problem with this. Asking makes you vulnerable.</em></h1><br>
    <h1>For most of human history, musicians, artists, they've been part of the community. Connectors and openers, not untouchable stars. Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance, but the Internet and the content that we're freely able to share on it are taking us back. It's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough.</h1>
