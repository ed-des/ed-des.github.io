			<h1>04-26: Touching on User Testing</h1>
		</header>
        <h1>Do it. Early + often. Some > nothing.</h1>
        <p>I wish we could spend more time on it, but like I said, some > nothing.</p>
        <p>You built a prototype last week. Whatever stage it is in, put it in front of a user and see how they engage with it. (We will break up in groups of 4).</p>
        <h1>Follow these protocol:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Let your user interact with your prototype for 2 minutes. Tell them to talk out loud about what they are noticing and what they are deciding to do at every moment. Do not say a word, even if they ask you questions. Just take notes.</li>
            <li>Now ask: Was there a point when you felt like "Aha â€“ I get what this is about."</li>
            <li>Then ask: Was there a point where you felt the most confused?</li>
            <li>Then ask: How would you explain this site/experience to a friend.</li>
            <li>Thank them for their time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Now ask yourself:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Did your user use your prototype as expected?</li>
            <li>What is the most important take-away from this experience?</li>
            <li>Are there new questions you have about the functionality of your prototype?</li>
            <li>Which questions were most effective</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now let's discuss how it went.</p>
